          Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and Virtual Reality applications with
          a particular focus on the pharmaceutical, medical and biotechnological
          sectors. Our goal is to make medical education fascinating,
          explorable, and fun for physicians, students as well as accessible to
          patients – anywhere and anytime, on congresses, medical offices,
          hospitals, in or out of the classroom, lecture hall or living room. We
          are passionate about taking medical education one step further and
          have developed visually stunning and highly interactive content based
          on real life medical and scientific specifications. As an
